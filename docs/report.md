# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstock.adobe.com%2Fsearch%3Fk%3Dwallpaper&psig=AOvVaw3xFhVWEHGzPNasG5rZq3-L&ust=1702634675223000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCPCqy8nWjoMDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)

# Ethics

## License
It became clear to us that choosing a license is important to us as developers and to provide guidelines for other developers. This is of course even more relevant if the application were to stay and generate profit.
Who have chosen the MIT license because of its simplisity and broad permissive nature. The MIT license is also ideal since .NET use the MIT license, however in this case it is not required to use the same license. 

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
A large level model is used for language understanding and generation. We have used ChatGPT and Co-Pilot in this project. We used these to expedite the coding in certain areas. 
We tried asking ChatGPT when hitting an error that we could not figure out why we recieved. ChatGPT could actually help finding the error sometimes, making this valueable to us.
Co-Pilot were used on the fly, as we were coding it would suggest what we might write, and often it was right and expidited the coding. It was also helpful, as we could write a comment stating what we want and Co-Pilot will then suggest the code for this. 
We have always been careful when using these tools as they may be wrong, inaccurate, etc. and researched upon information it gave that we were going to use. The way we used these tools it became a bit faster to write code, and sometimes **way** faster to debug!
